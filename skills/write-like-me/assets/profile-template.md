# Template — the profile's `VOICE.md`

Skeleton for the file `init` writes into the profile directory. This is **not** a
skill: it has no frontmatter, no `description:` and no mode table. Those belong
to `SKILL.md`, which is generic, ships with the skill, and is the same for every
author. What goes here is only what the corpus told you about one person.

Fill every `{{...}}`. Delete sections the corpus gave you no evidence for rather
than padding them with plausible guesses, and record in `VOICE_PROFILE.md` which
ones you dropped and why.

Section order below is by descending impact on the output, not by tidiness. The
applying agent reads top-down and its attention decays, so the deltas that change
word choice come before the descriptions of tendencies.

Write it in the language the author writes in. A profile for a Spanish author
reads better in Spanish, and the agent applying it is working in Spanish anyway.

# Voice — {{author}}

Evidence and corpus notes in `VOICE_PROFILE.md`. What may be asserted as fact
about {{author}}, in `GROUNDING.md`.

## Before you write

Find the closest same-format sample in `VOICE_PROFILE.md` and mirror its
structure, paragraphing and rhythm. Mirroring a real piece gets you closer than
any rule below — the rules are guardrails for what mirroring misses, not a
template to fill in.

## 1. Ban-list deltas

The skill loads the generic lists from its own `assets/` — this file cannot reach
them by path and must not try. This section is only what the corpus changed.

### Also never, for this author
{{banned words and turns verified absent from the corpus, or present only in
material the author disowned}}

### Exceptions — words the generic lists ban that are THEIRS
{{Do not strip these. One row per word, each with the quotation that earns it.}}

| Word | Proof |
|---|---|
| {{word}} | {{quote}} ({{source, year}}) |

### Capped, not banned
{{items allowed at most {{n}} times per piece, with the author's real
alternatives and their counts}}

### Stacking, not banning
{{patterns that are both signature and tell. Give the count: one use is voice,
{{n}} in a piece is a tell.}}

## 2. Don't perform the voice

Patterns here describe tendencies, not obligations.

- A phrase used once in the corpus is not a catchphrase. Don't build a running
  bit out of it. {{the specific one, and where it really came from}}
- An occasional habit is not a signature. {{author}} does {{x}} sometimes; every
  paragraph is a caricature.
- Don't manufacture roughness. Inserting deliberate errors or forced asides to
  seem human reads worse than clean prose. {{whether the author wants their real
  typos preserved — ask; most do not}}
- Don't turn any finding in this file into a tic. One observed use is a use.

## 3. Core patterns

**Correction direction: {{toward what}}.** {{The author's characteristic failure,
in their own corrections from Pass 3. Do not assume the usual "too tidy, too
neutral" — some authors' corrections pull the other way, and a rule written
backwards makes every draft worse.}}

{{3-6 patterns, each: the rule, then a wrong/right pair drawn from real corpus
text or from the author's own Pass 3 markings. The contrast carries the voice;
the prose around it is scaffolding.}}

**{{Pattern name}}**
{{one-line rule, with a count attached if one applies}}

| ❌ | ✅ |
|---|---|
| {{generic version}} | {{quoted or closely-modelled real line}} |

## 4. Registers

Called registers, not modes: `rewrite` and `edit` are modes, and reusing the word
for `formal`/`personal` guarantees a confusion that costs a whole draft.

Default: **{{register}}** — assume it unless the task says otherwise.

| Register | Address | Person | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{name}} | {{tú/usted/…}} | {{I/we}} | {{formats}} |

{{Mark any register the corpus does not evidence with ⚠️ and say so in the rule
itself, so the applying agent warns the author instead of inventing one.}}

### Openings
{{how {{author}} actually starts, with real examples. Highest-tell region of any
text — be specific and concrete.}}

### Closings
{{how they actually end. Generated text defaults to restating the argument and
turning outward on an uplift; say what {{author}} does instead.}}

## 5. What the sweeps check here

The skill owns the two-sweep structure. This says which sections each one walks.

**Sweep 1 — LLM-isms:** {{sections}}. {{author}}-specific things to count:
{{items}}.

**Sweep 2 — performance:** {{sections}}. The question that catches most of it for
{{author}}: {{the specific one}}.
```

## Notes for `init`

**On what belongs here** — apply the stranger test to every line. If it would be
identical for another author, it is method, it already lives in `SKILL.md` or
`assets/`, and repeating it here only costs context on every write.

**On sections you drop** — a section with `{{...}}` left in it, or filled with
confident-sounding filler, is worse than an absent one. Absence is honest and the
author can see the gap. Filler is invisible and gets applied.

**On length** — `VOICE.md` loads on every write, so it has to stay comfortably
promptable. Push evidence, counts, corpus notes and the reasoning behind each
rule into `VOICE_PROFILE.md`; keep this file to the rules and the samples they
hang on.

**On the unverified register** — the temptation is to fill the table row anyway
because a gap looks unfinished. Don't. A register with no corpus behind it is the
one place the profile can produce confident nonsense, and the ⚠️ is what makes
the applying agent say so out loud.
