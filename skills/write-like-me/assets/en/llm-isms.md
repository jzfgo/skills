# LLM-isms in English

Pair with `../shared/structural-tells.md` for the language-independent
shapes. This file covers lexis and fixed phrasing only.

**Provenance markers:**

- **[A]** — high confidence; strongly characteristic of generated text.
- **[B]** — common in generated text but also in ordinary formal register.
  Rate-limit rather than ban.
- **[?]** — watch-list; plausible, unverified.

> **Verification status.** The excess-vocabulary research (Kobak et al. 2025,
> *Science Advances*; Liang et al. 2024, arXiv:2404.01268) measured word-frequency
> shifts in scientific abstracts and is the right primary source for the **[A]**
> vocabulary items below. The verbatim ranked lists from those papers have **not
> yet been pulled into this file** — that research pass did not complete. Items
> here are drawn from observed patterns and widely-reported tells. Treat the
> vocabulary section as unfinished until the primary lists are merged, and note
> that the papers measure *academic* writing, so their rankings need adjusting
> before being applied to blogs, email, or social posts.

**Check every entry against the author's corpus before applying it.** English
lists over-suppress badly: `significant`, `comprehensive`, and `robust` are
ordinary words that a technical writer uses legitimately many times a week.

## How to use this list

1. **Filter against the corpus first.** A word the author uses in clean, pre-AI
   writing is theirs. Record it as an exception with the quote, and leave it
   alone. This step matters more in English than in Spanish because the lists
   are longer and the false-positive rate is higher.
2. **Rate-limit the [B] items** instead of banning them.
3. **Weight [A] items** heavily, and lead the emitted skill's ban list with
   openings and closings.
4. **Derive additional entries from absence** — what this author never writes,
   but generated text does.
